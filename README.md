# ME

I work as a full stack web developer while also attending university in pursuit of a Computer Science degree. I'm going into my third year. Known as the CRUD master in the office. Really enjoying Golang right now.

I'm always paying attention to the bleeding edge technologies that I think have potential to shake things up in the enterprise space.
